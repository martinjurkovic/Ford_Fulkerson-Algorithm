# Ford_Fulkerson-Algorithm
Implementation of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in java with network, edge and node data structures.

## Usage
Compile Main.java and input your graph as following:  
first, input number of nodes,  
then, input edges in format (fromNode, toNode, capacity).  
There is an example input (input.txt) for clarification.

### Output
The output is set to display all of the routes it finds and how much capacity that route can carry.

## The algorithm
The algorithm can be found at the bottom of the Network class in Network.java.
